            <p>arXiv:2506.22604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot end users increasingly require accessible means of specifying tasks for robots to perform. Two common end-user programming paradigms include drag-and-drop interfaces and natural language programming. Although natural language interfaces harness an intuitive form of human communication, drag-and-drop interfaces enable users to meticulously and precisely dictate the key actions of the robot's task. In this paper, we investigate the degree to which both approaches can be combined. Specifically, we construct a large language model (LLM)-based pipeline that accepts natural language as input and produces human-like action sequences as output, specified at a level of granularity that a human would produce. We then compare these generated action sequences to another dataset of hand-specified action sequences. Although our results reveal that larger models tend to outperform smaller ones in the production of human-like action sequences, smaller models nonetheless achieve satisfactory performance.</p>

            <p>arXiv:2506.22609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Games have long been used as benchmarks and testing environments for research in artificial intelligence. A key step in supporting this research was the development of game description languages: frameworks that compile domain-specific code into playable and simulatable game environments, allowing researchers to generalize their algorithms and approaches across multiple games without having to manually implement each one. More recently, progress in reinforcement learning (RL) has been largely driven by advances in hardware acceleration. Libraries like JAX allow practitioners to take full advantage of cutting-edge computing hardware, often speeding up training and testing by orders of magnitude. Here, we present a synthesis of these strands of research: a domain-specific language for board games which automatically compiles into hardware-accelerated code. Our framework, Ludax, combines the generality of game description languages with the speed of modern parallel processing hardware and is designed to fit neatly into existing deep learning pipelines. We envision Ludax as a tool to help accelerate games research generally, from RL to cognitive science, by enabling rapid simulation and providing a flexible representation scheme. We present a detailed breakdown of Ludax's description language and technical notes on the compilation process, along with speed benchmarking and a demonstration of training RL agents. The Ludax framework, along with implementations of existing board games, is open-source and freely available.</p>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have moved far beyond their initial form as simple chatbots, now carrying out complex reasoning, planning, writing, coding, and research tasks. These skills overlap significantly with those that human scientists use day-to-day to solve complex problems that drive the cutting edge of research. Using LLMs in "agentic" AI has the potential to revolutionize modern science and remove bottlenecks to progress. In this work, we present URSA, a scientific agent ecosystem for accelerating research tasks. URSA consists of a set of modular agents and tools, including coupling to advanced physics simulation codes, that can be combined to address scientific problems of varied complexity and impact. This work highlights the architecture of URSA, as well as examples that highlight the potential of the system.</p>

Abstract: Modern methods for explainable machine learning are designed to describe how models map inputs to outputs--without deep consideration of how these explanations will be used in practice. This paper argues that explanations should be designed and evaluated with a specific end in mind. We describe how to formalize this end in a framework based in statistical decision theory. We show how this functionally-grounded approach can be applied across diverse use cases, such as clinical decision support, providing recourse, or debugging. We demonstrate its use to characterize the maximum "boost" in performance on a particular task that an explanation could provide an idealized decision-maker, preventing misuse due to ambiguity by forcing researchers to specify concrete use cases that can be analyzed in light of models of expected explanation use. We argue that evaluation should meld theoretical and empirical perspectives on the value of explanation, and contribute definitions that span these perspectives.</p>

            <p>arXiv:2506.22774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology epitomizes the complex challenges posed by human-made artifacts, particularly those widely integrated into society and exert significant influence, highlighting potential benefits and their negative consequences. While other technologies may also pose substantial risks, AI's pervasive reach makes its societal effects especially profound. The complexity of AI systems, coupled with their remarkable capabilities, can lead to a reliance on technologies that operate beyond direct human oversight or understanding. To mitigate the risks that arise, several theoretical tools and guidelines have been developed, alongside efforts to create technological tools aimed at safeguarding Trustworthy AI. The guidelines take a more holistic view of the issue but fail to provide techniques for quantifying trustworthiness. Conversely, while technological tools are better at achieving such quantification, they lack a holistic perspective, focusing instead on specific aspects of Trustworthy AI. This paper aims to introduce an assessment method that combines the ethical components of Trustworthy AI with the algorithmic processes of PageRank and TrustRank. The goal is to establish an assessment framework that minimizes the subjectivity inherent in the self-assessment techniques prevalent in the field by introducing algorithmic criteria. The application of our approach indicates that a holistic assessment of an AI system's trustworthiness can be achieved by providing quantitative insights while considering the theoretical content of relevant guidelines.</p>

            <p>arXiv:2506.22865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed a significant performance gap between closed-source and open-source models, particularly in tasks requiring complex reasoning and precise instruction following. This paper introduces ReasonBridge, a methodology that efficiently transfers reasoning capabilities from powerful closed-source to open-source models through a novel hierarchical knowledge distillation framework. We develop a tailored dataset Reason1K with only 1,000 carefully curated reasoning traces emphasizing difficulty, diversity, and quality. These traces are filtered from across multiple domains using a structured multi-criteria selection algorithm. Our transfer learning approach incorporates: (1) a hierarchical distillation process capturing both strategic abstraction and tactical implementation patterns, (2) a sparse reasoning-focused adapter architecture requiring only 0.3% additional trainable parameters, and (3) a test-time compute scaling mechanism using guided inference interventions. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ReasonBridge improves reasoning capabilities in open-source models by up to 23% on benchmark tasks, significantly narrowing the gap with closed-source models. Notably, the enhanced Qwen2.5-14B outperforms Claude-Sonnet3.5 on MATH500 and matches its performance on competition-level AIME problems. Our methodology generalizes effectively across diverse reasoning domains and model architectures, establishing a sample-efficient approach to reasoning enhancement for instruction following.</p>

Abstract: After a very long winter, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) spring is here. Or, so it seems over the last three years. AI has the potential to impact many areas of human life - personal, social, health, education, professional. In this paper, we take a closer look at the potential of AI for Enterprises, where decision-making plays a crucial and repeated role across functions, tasks, and operations. We consider Agents imbued with AI as means to increase decision-productivity of enterprises. We highlight six tenets for Agentic success in enterprises, by drawing attention to what the current, AI-Centric User paradigm misses, in the face of persistent needs of and usefulness for Enterprise Decision-Making. In underscoring a shift to User-Centric AI, we offer six tenets and promote market mechanisms for platforms, aligning the design of AI and its delivery by Agents to the cause of enterprise users.</p>

            <p>arXiv:2506.22919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable conditional computation by routing inputs to specialized experts, but these experts rely on identical inductive biases, thus limiting representational diversity. This static computation pathway is inefficient for inputs that require different types of reasoning and limits specialization and interpretability. We propose Hecto, a lightweight MoE architecture that leverages architectural heterogeneity by combining a GRU expert for temporal reasoning and an FFNN expert for static abstraction under a sparse Top-1 gating mechanism. Evaluated on three reasoning benchmarks (AG News, SST-2, HotpotQA) and a regression task (STS-B), Hecto matches or closely trails homogeneous baselines in performance despite receiving isolated input representations, while achieving clear expert specialization, with each expert aligning to distinct reasoning types (temporal vs static). At larger batch sizes, Hecto exhibits improved performance, benefiting from relaxed computational constraints that allow its heterogeneous architecture to optimize more effectively. Ablation results isolate architectural diversity as the source of Hecto's stability and interpretability across diverse reasoning tasks. Overall, Hecto establishes itself as a new benchmark for conditional computation, offering a principled framework for specialized reasoning in low-resource regimes with its model strength derived from principled specialization.</p>

            <p>arXiv:2506.22920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable reasoning abilities in various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, recent studies indicate that even the best models lack true comprehension of their reasoning processes. In this paper, we explore how self-play can enhance the rationality of models in the reasoning process without supervision from humans or superior models. We design a Critic-Discernment Game(CDG) in which a prover first provides a solution to a given problem and is subsequently challenged by critiques of its solution. These critiques either aim to assist or mislead the prover. The objective of the prover is to maintain the correct answer when faced with misleading comments, while correcting errors in response to constructive feedback. Our experiments on tasks involving mathematical reasoning, stepwise error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning demonstrate that CDG training can significantly improve the ability of well-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process.</p>

            <p>arXiv:2506.22992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to process information from multiple modalities and to reason through it step-by-step remains a critical challenge in advancing artificial intelligence. However, existing reasoning benchmarks focus on text-only reasoning, or employ multimodal questions that can be answered by directly retrieving information from a non-text modality. Thus, complex reasoning remains poorly understood in multimodal domains. Here, we present MARBLE, a challenging multimodal reasoning benchmark that is designed to scrutinize multimodal language models (MLLMs) in their ability to carefully reason step-by-step through complex multimodal problems and environments. MARBLE is composed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the crafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and physical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE -- all the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0% accuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the random baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for existing MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where MLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By shedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the development of the next generation of models with the ability to reason and plan across many, multimodal reasoning steps.</p>
